Overview of the Project

Project: To-Do List Web Application

Objective This To-Do List web application was developed during my internship at CodeTech Solutions. The primary objective of this project is to streamline task management through a simple and intuitive user interface. Users can effortlessly add and delete tasks, ensuring efficient organization of their to-dos.

Features Add Tasks: Easily add new tasks using the input field and "Add" button. Delete Tasks: Remove tasks individually or in bulk with a single click.

Technologies Used HTML: Provides the structure for the web application. CSS: Styles the application with a clean and modern design. JavaScript: Implements the interactive functionalities, such as adding, editing, deleting, and saving tasks.

Development Details Responsive Design: Ensures a seamless user experience across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Usage Add a Task: Enter a task in the input field and click the "Add" button. Edit a Task: Click on the radio button to enable editing that if it is done the text tranforms to line-through decoration. Delete a Task: Click the "X" button next to the task to remove it from the list.

Future Enhancements Task Prioritization: Implement features to assign priority levels to tasks (e.g., high, medium, low). Due Dates and Reminders: Enable users to set due dates and receive notifications for upcoming tasks. Category Tags: Provide options to categorize tasks using tags for better organization. Cloud Storage Integration: Sync tasks across devices using cloud storage solutions.
